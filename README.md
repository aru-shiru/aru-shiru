## What I Do

Senior engineer and technical lead with 9+ years shipping production systems at scale — 1.6M users, 300K volunteers across 18 concurrent organizations, systems replacing apps with 1.5M installs. I architect and deliver complex, multi-platform products end-to-end: from Flutter and React Native mobile apps to NestJS and Laravel backends, PostgreSQL schemas, and cloud infrastructure. I've been building Flutter apps since 2019 (pre-null-safety through Riverpod and offline-first architectures), and equally comfortable across the full web and backend stack. I lead small focused teams, set architecture standards, and still write the hard code myself. 30+ projects shipped across government, political tech, healthcare, agriculture, and enterprise domains in Indonesia and Japan.

### e-Watch LSI — Political Fieldwork Monitoring Platform
> Real-time field operations monitoring for a political survey/consulting firm — tracking canvassing activities, geotagged evidence, and survey responses across Indonesian election campaigns.

- Riverpod feature-sliced architecture across login, home, dropping, persuasi, and draft domains — one notifier per concern, cross-provider reactivity, with custom-token auth via Cloud Functions letting field workers log in with username/password (no email required)
- Multi-tenant single APK: same binary serves multiple client organizations; feature modules and dynamic questionnaires loaded per-tenant from Firestore, with dual-resolution image pipeline streamed through a `FormStatus` state machine
